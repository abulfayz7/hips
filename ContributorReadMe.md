## Become a Contributor

Here are some ways you can help:

* "[Watch](https://github.com/hss5747/HashShare-Core)" this
  repository to be notified of issues and Pull Requests (PRs) that could use
  your attention.

    Alternatively, email volunteer coordinator Lee Soobin
    ([hashshare@hashshare.org](mailto:hashshare@hashshare.org))
    with a short list of your interests and skills, and they will email you when
    there's an issue or PR that could use your attention.

* Help write new documentation
  for the [developer documentation pages](https://github.com/hss5747/HashShare-Core/tree/master/doc)
  or full node page, or **review PRs
  adding new documentation.**
  You don't need to be a crypto expert to review a PR---these docs are written
  for non-experts, so we need to know if non-experts find them confusing or
  incomplete. If you review a PR and don't find any problems worth commenting
  about, leave a "Looks Good To Me (LGTM)" comment.

* Submit new wallets
  for the Choose Your Wallet page or
  help us review wallet submissions.

* [Translate Hashshare.org](https://hashshare.org/), [Hashshare.biz](https://hashshare.org/) and other documents into another language
  or help review new and updated translations.


* Help improve Hashshare another way. Email volunteer coordinator Lee Soobin ([hashshare@hashshare.org](mailto:hashshare@hashshare.org))c to let us know how what you're interested in and how you'd like to get involved.
